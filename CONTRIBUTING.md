# Contributing to DHI-trial

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the repo, whether or not they're part of the trial group. Before helping out, please [set up a GitHub account](https://github.com). Those who aren't collaborators can freely create issues in the [Issues][] tab. Changes can be suggested using [pull requests][]. This repo will be maintained as a centralized hub for the DHI's GitHub organization. It will have project templates, help guides, and best practices.

## Issues

Issues get the whole process started. Any discussion should be done through Issues. This way, we have an organized and tagged log that will always be available to everyone. Hopefully, this will lead to less cluttered inboxes and fewer live meetings.

Use the tags to help organize issues. Most are self-explanatory, but two mean something special for this repo:

1. `enhancement`: Task
  - This is a measurable goal for the trial. When a commit is made that completes the task, the issue will be closed with a reference to that commit.
2. `bug`: Problem
  - Whether code-based (error running a program) or organizational (we can't release certain information), this needs to be fixed. Once fixed, it will be closed with a reference to the fixing commit.

## Contributions

Most contributions to this repository will fall into two categories.

## Testing files

These are files with (mostly) arbitrary content. They only exist to be added, edited, removed, and wiped from the repo's history in order to learn the ins and outs of GitHub. The code in a file matters when it tests different ways to get SAS projects to work well as GitHub repos.

## Help guides

After a feature has been tested and a "best practice" approach to it for the DHI has been decided, this approach will be recorded in the repo's [Wiki][].
