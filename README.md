# DHI-trial

This repository will be used by the Pennsylvania Division of Health Informatics (DHI) to try out GitHub.

Members of the trial team (anyone, really) should feel free to interact with the repository as they want (within the rules listed below). We need to decide how to handle as many situations as possible.

## Rules

Most of these rules are common sense. Remember: this is a *public* repository. You should consider all files in it to be documents released to the public. If you shouldn't say or give something in an email for a data request, then it shouldn't go here.

1. Please do not delete the repository.
1. Do not add any file that has any of the following:
  - Confidential information
  - Personally identifiable information
  - Contact information for anyone besides yourself
  - Server paths (these are potential security holes)

## Suggestions

- Only add files that are human-readable. Difference tracking doesn't make much sense otherwise. If you want to upload a data set, then use a text version (CSV, fixed-width, etc.).
- Try to keep the files small. Large data files are rarely edited directly, so it's better to simply back them up than version.
- Forking is your friend, and not that hard.
- Please try out every feature you can (except "Delete repository") and let the rest of us know how it goes.

## Collaboration

Since this is just a trial repository, the Issues section can also be used as a discussion forum. The more we use it, the less often we need to set up face-to-face meetings.

## Git

If you feel adventurous, try installing and using [git](https://git-scm.com/) to work with the repository. Clone it to your desktop, make some changes, then submit a pull request to the online repository.

[Git Magic](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/) seems like a good guide for using the git software. Since we use Windows, Git Bash (comes with the git) is the best interface.
